      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a lawyer working at a law firm specialising in personal injury with an avid interest in coding and software development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Sydney, Australia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I like to go out and be active as much as I like to stay home, read, nap and watch some netflix.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a lawyer in a law firm that embraces technological changes</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Sydney, Australia</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>The law firm at which I practice is in the middle of developing their own platform. I have garnered a strong interest in programming and development as I observed first-hand how much easier our work was becoming through AI and bots that were integrated into the platforms. I would like to be able to create my own bots, platforms, software etc to be able to reach a pinnacle in efficiency and productivity so that minimal time is spent on mundane tasks, and more effort and time is put into significant work that goes into changing lives. </p>
